# Yet Another GMP C++ Wrapper for High-Precision Calculations

## Overview

`gmpxx_mkII` is a C++ class designed to facilitate high-precision arithmetic operations using the GMP library, which is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license. GMP is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations. This class provides a convenient, alternative C++ wrapper around the GMP library's functionalities.

### Features

- High-level source compatibility with `gmpxx.h`
- Implementation of trigonometric (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, etc.) and transcendental functions (log, exp)
- Licensed under the 2-clause BSD License
- Written from scratch

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
